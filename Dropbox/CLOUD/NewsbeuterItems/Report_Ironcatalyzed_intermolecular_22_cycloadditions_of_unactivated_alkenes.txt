Cycloadditions, such as the [4+2] Diels-Alder reaction to form six-membered 
rings, are among the most powerful and widely used methods in synthetic 
chemistry. The analogous [2+2] alkene cycloaddition to synthesize cyclobutanes 
is kinetically accessible by photochemical methods, but the substrate scope and
functional group tolerance are limited. Here, we report iron-catalyzed 
intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of unactivated alkenes and cross 
cycloaddition of alkenes and dienes as regio- and stereoselective routes to 
cyclobutanes. Through rational ligand design, development of this base 
metalâ€“catalyzed method expands the chemical space accessible from abundant 
hydrocarbon feedstocks. Authors: Jordan M. Hoyt, Valerie A. Schmidt, Aaron M.
