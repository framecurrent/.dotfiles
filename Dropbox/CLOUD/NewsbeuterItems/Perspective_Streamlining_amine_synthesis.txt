Amines, a collective name for compounds that contain one or more nitrogen 
atoms, and their derivatives make up the overwhelming majority of drug 
molecules and agrochemicals, as well as many compounds that are produced by 
plants and living organisms (i.e., natural products) (1, 2). Not surprisingly, 
organic chemists spend a considerable amount of time with the synthesis and 
late-stage functionalization of amines. On page 886 of this issue, Gui et al. 
(3) report a highly innovative iron-catalyzed cross-coupling of olefins with 
nitroarenes, both of which are readily available and inexpensive, to afford 
bulky secondary arylamines that are either very difficult to obtain or 
inaccessible with existing methods. Author: László Kürti
