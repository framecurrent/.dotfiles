Abstract

While the gold(I)-catalyzed glycosylation reaction with 4,6-O-benzylidene 
tethered mannosyl ortho-alkynylbenzoates as donors falls squarely into the 
category of the Crich-type β-selective mannosylation when Ph[3]PAuOTf is used 
as the catalyst, in that the mannosyl α-triflates are invoked, replacement of 
the ^−OTf in the gold(I) complex with less nucleophilic counter anions (i.e., ^
−NTf[2], ^−SbF[6], ^−BF[4], and ^−BAr[4]^F) leads to complete loss of 
β-selectivity with the mannosyl ortho-alkynylbenzoate β-donors. Nevertheless, 
with the α-donors, the mannosylation reactions under the catalysis of Ph[3]
PAuBAr[4]^F (BAr[4]^F=tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate) are 
especially highly β-selective and accommodate a broad scope of substrates; 
these include glycosylation with mannosyl donors installed with a bulky TBS 
group at O3, donors bearing 4,6-di-O-benzoyl groups, and acceptors known as 
sterically unmatched or hindered. For the ortho-alkynylbenzoate β-donors, an 
anomerization and glycosylation sequence can also ensure the highly β-selective
mannosylation. The 1-α-mannosyloxy-isochromenylium-4-gold(I) complex (Cα), 
readily generated upon activation of the α-mannosyl ortho-alkynylbenzoate (1 α)
with Ph[3]PAuBAr[4]^F at −35 °C, was well characterized by NMR spectroscopy; 
the occurrence of this species accounts for the high β-selectivity in the 
present mannosylation.

Some like it gold: With the non-coordinating ^−BAr[4]^F 
(tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate) as a counter anion, 
gold(I)-activation of the α-mannopyranosyl ortho-alkynylbenzoates leads to the 
corresponding 1-α-mannosyloxy-isochromenylium-4-gold(I) complex, which upon 
treatment with alcohols might afford the important but difficult-to-synthesize 
β-mannopyranosides (see scheme).
