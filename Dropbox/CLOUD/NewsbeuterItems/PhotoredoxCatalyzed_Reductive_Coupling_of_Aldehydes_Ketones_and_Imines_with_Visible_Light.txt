Abstract

Ketyl radical and amino radical anions, valuable reactive intermediates for C[image 1]
C bond-forming reactions, are accessible through a C[image 2]O/C[image 2]NR 
umpolung. However, their utilization in catalysis remains largely 
underdeveloped owing to the high reduction potential of carbonyl compounds and 
imines. In the context of photoredox catalysis, tertiary amines are commonly 
employed as sacrificial co-reducing agents. Herein, an additional role of the 
amine is proposed, in which it is essential for the organocatalytic substrate 
activation. The combination of photoredox catalysis and carbonyl/imine 
activation enables the reductive coupling of aldehydes, ketones, and imines 
under mild reaction conditions.

Overcoming the redox barrier with the amine playing a dual role: The 
photoredox-catalyzed reductive coupling of aldehydes, ketones, and imines was 
achieved with low catalyst loading, under mild reaction conditions, and wide 
functional-group tolerance (see scheme; PS=photosensitizer).
