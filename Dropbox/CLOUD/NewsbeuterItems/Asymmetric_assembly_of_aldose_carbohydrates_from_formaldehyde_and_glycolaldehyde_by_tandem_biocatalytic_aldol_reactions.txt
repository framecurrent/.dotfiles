Forged by evolution, the natural enzymatic pathways to aldose carbohydrates are
complex. Now, a biocatalytic stereoselective one-pot assembly of these 
carbohydrates from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde using engineered 
D-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase (FSA) variants has been developed that 
circumvents this complexity.
