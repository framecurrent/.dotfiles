Computations of the energetics and mechanism of the Morita–Baylis–Hillman 
reaction are “not even wrong” when compared with experiments. While 
computational abstinence may be the purest way to calculate challenging 
reaction mechanisms, taking prophylactic measures to avoid regrettable outcomes
may be more realistic.
