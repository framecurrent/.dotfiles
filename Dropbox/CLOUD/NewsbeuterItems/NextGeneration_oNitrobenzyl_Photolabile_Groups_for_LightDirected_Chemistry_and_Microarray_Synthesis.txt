Abstract

Light as an external trigger is a valuable and easily controllable tool for 
directing chemical reactions with high spatial and temporal accuracy. Two o
-nitrobenzyl derivatives, benzoyl- and thiophenyl-NPPOC, undergo 
photo-deprotection with significantly improved efficiency over that of the 
commonly used NPPOC group. The two- and twelvefold increase in 
photo-deprotection efficiency was proven using photolithograph synthesis of 
microarrays.

High-speed photolysis: The highly light-sensitive groups benzoyl- and 
thiophenyl-NPPOC (NPPOC=2-(2-nitrophenyl)propoxycarbonyl) were used for 
light-directed, spatio-selective synthesis. Their photolytic efficiencies are 
two- and twelvefold greater than that of NPPOC, respectively.
