Developing bio-compatible smart materials that assemble in response to 
environmental cues requires strategies that can discriminate multiple specific 
stimuli in a complex milieu. Synthetic materials have yet to achieve this level
of sensitivity, which would emulate the highly evolved and tailored reaction 
networks of complex biological systems. Here we show that the output of a 
naturally occurring network can be replaced with a synthetic material. 
Exploiting the blood coagulation system as an exquisite biological sensor, the 
fibrin clot end-product was replaced with a synthetic material under the 
biological control of a precisely regulated cross-linking enzyme. The functions
of the coagulation network remained intact when the material was incorporated. 
Clot-like polymerization was induced in indirect response to distinct small 
molecules, phospholipids, enzymes, cells, viruses, an inorganic solid, a 
polyphenol, a polysaccharide, and a membrane protein. This strategy 
demonstrates for the first time that an existing stimulus-responsive biological
network can be used to control the formation of a synthetic material by diverse
classes of physiological triggers.
