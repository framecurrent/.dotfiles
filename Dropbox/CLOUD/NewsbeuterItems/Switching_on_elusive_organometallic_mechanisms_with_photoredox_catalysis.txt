Transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions have become one of the most
used carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bond-forming reactions in chemical 
synthesis. Recently, nickel catalysis has been shown to participate in a wide 
variety of C−C bond-forming reactions, most notably Negishi, Suzuki–Miyaura, 
Stille, Kumada and Hiyama couplings. Despite the tremendous advances in C−C 
fragment couplings, the ability to forge C−O bonds in a general fashion via 
nickel catalysis has been largely unsuccessful. The challenge for 
nickel-mediated alcohol couplings has been the mechanistic requirement for the 
critical C–O bond-forming step (formally known as the reductive elimination 
step) to occur via a Ni(iii) alkoxide intermediate. Here we demonstrate that 
visible-light-excited photoredox catalysts can modulate the preferred oxidation
states of nickel alkoxides in an operative catalytic cycle, thereby providing 
transient access to Ni(iii) species that readily participate in reductive 
elimination. Using this synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis, 
we have developed a highly efficient and general carbon–oxygen coupling 
reaction using abundant alcohols and aryl bromides. More notably, we have 
developed a general strategy to ‘switch on’ important yet elusive 
organometallic mechanisms via oxidation state modulations using only weak light
and single-electron-transfer catalysts.
