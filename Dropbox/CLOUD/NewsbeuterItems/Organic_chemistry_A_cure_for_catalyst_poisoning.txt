Organic chemistry: A cure for catalyst poisoning

Nature 524, 7564 (2015). doi:10.1038/524164a[1]

Authors: Marcus E. Farmer & Phil S. Baran

Compounds that are sensitive to the components of air are difficult to use in 
chemical reactions, requiring conditions that are tedious to set up. A simple, 
practical solution to this problem has finally been devised. See Letter p.208
