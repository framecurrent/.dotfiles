Tridecafullerenes with 120 peripheral carbohydrate groups have been made in one
step from hexakis-adducts of [60]fullerene by using azide–alkyne click 
chemistry. This synthetic approach offers control over the size and 
multivalency of these ‘sugar superballs', which are shown to be potent 
inhibitors of cell infection by an artificial Ebola virus, with IC50 values in 
the sub-nanomolar range.
