Abstract

Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) explores the thermodynamic equilibrium of
reversible reactions. Its application in the discovery of protein binders is 
largely limited by difficulties in the analysis of complex reaction mixtures. 
DNA-encoded chemical library (DECL) technology allows the selection of binders 
from a mixture of up to billions of different compounds; however, experimental 
results often show low a signal-to-noise ratio and poor correlation between 
enrichment factor and binding affinity. Herein we describe the design and 
application of DNA-encoded dynamic combinatorial chemical libraries (EDCCLs). 
Our experiments have shown that the EDCCL approach can be used not only to 
convert monovalent binders into high-affinity bivalent binders, but also to 
cause remarkably enhanced enrichment of potent bivalent binders by driving 
their in situ synthesis. We also demonstrate the application of EDCCLs in 
DNA-templated chemical reactions.

Selection goes dynamic: Dynamic combinatorial chemistry explores the 
thermodynamic equilibrium of reversible reactions. DNA-encoded chemical 
libraries enable the selection of binders from compound mixtures. Now the 
advantages of DNA-encoded dynamic combinatorial chemical libraries for the 
selection of protein binders from a myriad of compounds (see picture) and for 
DNA-templated reactions are demonstrated.
