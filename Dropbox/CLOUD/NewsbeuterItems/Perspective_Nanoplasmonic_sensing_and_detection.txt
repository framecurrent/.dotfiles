Measuring minute amounts of chemical and biological objects in the environment 
and in living organisms is one of the most common and important tasks in 
chemistry, biology, medicine, environmental monitoring, transportation, 
homeland security, and defense. Although the existing methods of sensing and 
detection are numerous and powerful, they are not without shortcomings: 
insufficient sensitivity; long detection times; necessity for enzymatic, 
fluorescent, or radioactive labeling; high costs, and so on. Optical 
spectroscopic methods have the advantage of being fast, noncontact, and 
relatively inexpensive, but they are not necessarily sensitive enough. Author:
