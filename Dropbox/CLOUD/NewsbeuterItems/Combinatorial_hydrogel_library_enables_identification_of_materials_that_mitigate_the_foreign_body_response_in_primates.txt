The foreign body response is an immune-mediated reaction that can lead to the 
failure of implanted medical devices and discomfort for the recipient. There is
a critical need for biomaterials that overcome this key challenge in the 
development of medical devices. Here we use a combinatorial approach for 
covalent chemical modification to generate a large library of variants of one 
of the most widely used hydrogel biomaterials, alginate. We evaluated the 
materials in vivo and identified three triazole-containing analogs that 
substantially reduce foreign body reactions in both rodents and, for at least 6
months, in non-human primates. The distribution of the triazole modification 
creates a unique hydrogel surface that inhibits recognition by macrophages and 
fibrous deposition. In addition to the utility of the compounds reported here, 
our approach may enable the discovery of other materials that mitigate the 
foreign body response.
