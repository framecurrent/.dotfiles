The current clinical management of TB is complicated by the lack of suitable 
diagnostic tests that can be employed in infrastructure and resource poor 
regions. The mannose-capped form of lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) is unique to the
surface envelope of slow-growing, pathogenic mycobacteria such as 
M.tuberculosis (M.tb) and facilitates passive invasion of mononuclear 
phagocytes. The detection of this virulence factor in urine, sputum and serum 
has engendered interest in its employment as a biomarker for M.tb infection. In
this study, we utilize a subtractive screening methodology to engineer the 
first high affinity recombinant antibody (My2F12) with exquisite specificity 
for the Î±1-2 mannose linkages enriched in ManLAM from M.tb. My2F12 binds to 
pathogenic mycobacterial species but not fast growing non-pathogenic species. 
Testing on matched urine and serum samples from TB patients indicates that 
My2F12 works in patient cohorts missed by other diagnostic methodologies.
