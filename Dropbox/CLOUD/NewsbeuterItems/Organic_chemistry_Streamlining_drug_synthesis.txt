Organic chemistry: Streamlining drug synthesis

Nature 520, 7547 (2015). doi:10.1038/520302a[1]

Authors: Joel M. Hawkins

Drug manufacture can benefit from flow synthesis, in which raw materials are 
fed into a sequence of reactors, producing the drug as a continuous output. A 
flow strategy that capitalizes on solid catalysts has now been realized. See 
Letter p.329
