Abstract

A rapid and catalyst-free cycloaddition system for visible-light-induced click 
chemistry is reported. A readily accessible photoreactive 2H-azirine moiety was
designed to absorb light at wavelengths above 400 nm. Irradiation with 
low-energy light sources thus enables efficient small-molecule synthesis with a
diverse range of multiple-bond-containing compounds. Moreover, in order to 
demonstrate the efficiency of the current approach, quantitative ligation of 
the photoactivatable chromophore with functional polymeric substrates was 
performed and full conversion with irradiation times of only 1 min at ambient 
conditions was achieved. The current report thus presents a highly efficient 
method for applications involving selective cycloaddition to electron-deficient
multiple-bond-containing materials.

Quick as a flash: A rapid and catalyst-free cycloaddition system for 
visible-light-induced click chemistry at ambient conditions is reported. 
Irradiation of a 2H-azirine moiety with low-energy light sources enables 
efficient small-molecule synthesis with a diverse range of 
multiple-bond-containing compounds, as well as rapid quantitative ligation of 
the photoactivatable chromophore with polymeric substrates.
