Abstract

A new correlation experiment cited as “push-G-SERF” is reported. In the 
resulting phased 2D spectrum, the chemical shift information is selected along 
the direct dimension, whereas scalar couplings involving a selected proton 
nucleus are edited in the indirect domain. The robustness of this pulse 
sequence is demonstrated on compounds with increasing structural and spectral 
complexity, using state-of-the-art spectrometers. It allows for full resolution
of both dimensions of the spectrum, yielding a straightforward assignment and 
measurement of the coupling network around a given proton in the molecule. This
experiment is intended for chemists who want to address efficiently the 
structural analysis of molecules with an overcrowded spectrum.

Serfin′ NMR: We report a new correlation experiment (“push-G-Serf”) with full 
resolution along both spectral dimensions that allows for an easy and fast 
structural analysis in complex molecules through a straightforward assignment 
and measurement of the homonuclear coupling network around a selected proton in
the molecule.
