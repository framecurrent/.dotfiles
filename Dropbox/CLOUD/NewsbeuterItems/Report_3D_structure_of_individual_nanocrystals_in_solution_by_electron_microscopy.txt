Knowledge about the synthesis, growth mechanisms, and physical properties of 
colloidal nanoparticles has been limited by technical impediments. We introduce
a method for determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of individual 
nanoparticles in solution. We combine a graphene liquid cell, high-resolution 
transmission electron microscopy, a direct electron detector, and an algorithm 
for single-particle 3D reconstruction originally developed for analysis of 
biological molecules. This method yielded two 3D structures of individual 
platinum nanocrystals at near-atomic resolution. Because our method derives the
3D structure from images of individual nanoparticles rotating freely in 
solution, it enables the analysis of heterogeneous populations of potentially 
unordered nanoparticles that are synthesized in solution, thereby providing a 
means to understand the structure and stability of defects at the nanoscale.
