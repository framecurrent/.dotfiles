Abstract

A general and efficient protocol for the palladium-catalyzed functionalization 
of mono- and polyglycosyl thiols by using the palladacycle precatalyst 
G3-XantPhos was developed. The C[image 1]S bond-forming reaction was achieved 
rapidly at room temperature with various functionalized (hetero)aryl-, 
alkenyl-, and alkynyl halides. The functional group tolerance on the 
electrophilic partner is typically high and anomer selectivities of 
thioglycosides are high in all cases studied. New sulfur nucleophiles such as 
thiophenols, alkythiols, and thioaminoacids (cysteine) were also successfully 
coupled to lead to the most general and practical method yet reported for the 
functionalization of thiols.
