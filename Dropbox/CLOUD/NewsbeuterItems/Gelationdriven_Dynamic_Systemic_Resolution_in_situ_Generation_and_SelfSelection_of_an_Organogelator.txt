An organogelator was produced and identified from a dynamic imine system, 
resolved and amplified by selective gelation. The formation of the organogel 
was monitored in situ by 1H NMR, showing the existence of multiple reversible 
reactions operating simultaneously, and the redistribution of the involved 
species during gelation. The formed organogelator proved effective with a range
of organic solvents, including DMSO, toluene, and longer, linear alcohols.
