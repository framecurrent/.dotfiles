Abstract

The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)-catalyzed hydrogenation and deuteration of N-
benzylidene-tert-butylamine (2) was kinetically investigated by using the three
boranes B(C[6]F[5])[3] (1), B(2,4,6-F[3]-C[6]H[2])[3] (4), and B(2,6-F[2]-C[6]H[
3])[3] (5) and the free activation energies for the H[2] activation by FLP were
determined. Reactions catalyzed by the weaker Lewis acids 4 and 5 displayed 
autoinductive catalysis arising from a higher free activation energy 
(2 kcal mol^−1) for the H[2] activation by the imine compared to the amine. 
Surprisingly, the imine reduction using D[2] proceeded with higher rates. This 
phenomenon is unprecedented for FLP and resulted from a primary inverse 
equilibrium isotope effect.

The FLP-catalyzed reaction of N-benzylidene-tert-butylamine with H[2] and D[2] 
was kinetically investigated. The free activation energy for the H[2] 
activation by the FLP consisting of imine and a less Lewis-acidic borane is 
2 kcal mol^−1 higher than for B(C[6]F[5])[3] resulting in autoinduced 
catalysis. For the first time the free activation enthalpies for the H[2] 
activation by FLPs were experimentally determined and an inverse kinetic 
isotope effect was observed.
