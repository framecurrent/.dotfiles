Living large: Rational design of self-assembly pathways has been demonstrated 
in supramolecular polymers. By controlling the concentration of an 
aggregation-competent monomer through intramolecular interactions, living 
supramolecular polymerization conditions were achieved. This universal approach
can be used to obtain aggregates of well-defined length and narrow dispersity, 
and allows access to new supramolecular polymer architectures.
