Verizon, the largest US wireless carrier by subscribers, was slapped with a 
$1.35 million fine[2] by the US Federal Communications Commission yesterday 
(March 7) for its use of “supercookies” that track users’ web browsing activity
without their knowledge.

The terms “supercookies,” “permacookies,” or “zombie cookies”—as these trackers
are commonly referred to—are a bit of a misnomer. Unlike regular cookies, which
are bits of data stored locally on a device after being downloaded from 
websites, “supercookies” are not cookies at all. The Unique Identifier Headers 
(UIDH) used by Verizon were injected at the network level when users visited 
websites over an encrypted connection.

Here’s a brief guide to how tracking headers are used, where they’re found, and
how to opt out.

Tailored advertising

Tracking headers identify people’s web behavior by building up a profile of 
unencrypted sites (those sent over HTTP) that they visited. Third parties that 
pay for access to these profiles can then use that data to send targeted 
information, such as advertisements, to people. But because all this 
information is injected every time a user makes an HTTP request, sites can 
easily detect if there’s a tracking header. So, even if the carrier doesn’t 
sell data collected from supercookies to advertisers, third-party firms[4] can 
independently identify the supercookies for advertising purposes.

Carriers

According to an online test by Access Now[6], an organization that advocates 
for digital rights, supercookies have been used for at least a decade[7] and 
are most prevalent in the US, followed by Spain and the Netherlands. They have 
also been found in Canada, China, India, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, the 
Netherlands, and Venezuela.

Of 180,000 results returned from a test created by Access Now, 15% showed the 
presence[8] of tracking headers. In the US, the two largest carriers, Verizon 
and AT&T, have deployed these tracking headers, though AT&T said in 2014 that 
they were “phased off our network[9].” Other mobile carriers that have used 
tracking headers include Bell Canada, Bharti Airtel, Cricket, Telefonica de 
España, Viettel Peru, and Vodafone, according to Access Now.

Potential security risk

Access Now notes that some supercookies can leak users’ information, such as 
phone numbers. While there hasn’t been evidence suggesting criminals have taken
advantage of this vulnerability, it is worrying that private information is 
stored in clear text. The rich data collected on users could also make carriers
targets for government surveillance requests, the organization warns.

Check if you’re tracked

You can use Access Now’s tool to check if your mobile carrier deploys tracking 
headers at amibeingtracked.com[10].

Opting out

Because these trackers are injected at the network level, there’s no way for 
users to block supercookies.

As part of Verizon’s settlement with the FCC, the carrier will need to get 
customers’ permission to share its tracking data with third parties, but users 
still have to manually opt out. Verizon users can do so by going into the 
settings page[11].
