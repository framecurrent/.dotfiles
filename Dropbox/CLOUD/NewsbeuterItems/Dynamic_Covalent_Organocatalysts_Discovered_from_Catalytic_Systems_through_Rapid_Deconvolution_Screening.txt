Abstract

The first example of a bifunctional organocatalyst assembled through dynamic 
covalent chemistry (DCC) is described. The catalyst is based on reversible 
imine chemistry and can catalyze the Morita–Baylis–Hillman (MBH) reaction of 
enones with aldehydes or N-tosyl imines. Furthermore, these dynamic catalysts 
were shown to be optimizable through a systemic screening approach, in which 
large mixtures of catalyst structures were generated, and the optimal catalyst 
could be directly identified by using dynamic deconvolution. This strategy 
allowed one-pot synthesis and in situ evaluation of several potential catalysts
without the need to separate, characterize, and purify each individual 
structure. The systems were furthermore shown to catalyze and re-equilibrate 
their own formation through a previously unknown thiourea-catalyzed 
transimination process.

Catalyst screening: By using dynamic covalent chemistry, systems of 
bifunctional catalysts incorporating dynamic imine bonds within the scaffold 
have been developed and have been shown to equilibrate under catalysis of one 
of the system members. Furthermore, the optimal catalyst for a 
Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction could be identified in situ through strategic 
dynamic deconvolution (see scheme).
