Fabai Wu, Cees DekkerWe review the use of nanofabricated structures and 
microfluidic technologies that spatially separate bacteria for quantitative 
analyses and that provide topological constraints on their growth and chemical 
communications.To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the
