David Andrew Fulton, Michael Edward BracchiOrthogonal bond-breaking and forming
of dynamic covalent disulfide and imine bonds in aqueous solution is 
demonstrated. Through judicious choice of reaction partners, it is possible to 
cleave and reform selectively...The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal
