The study of light at the nanoscale has become a vibrant field of research, as 
researchers now master the flow of light at length scales far below the optical
wavelength, largely surpassing the classical limits imposed by diffraction. 
Using metallic and dielectric nanostructures precisely sculpted into 
two-dimensional (2D) and 3D nanoarchitectures, light can be scattered, 
refracted, confined, filtered, and processed in fascinating new ways that are 
impossible to achieve with natural materials and in conventional geometries. 
This control over light at the nanoscale has not only unveiled a plethora of 
new phenomena but has also led to a variety of relevant applications, including
new venues for integrated circuitry, optical computing, solar, and medical 
technologies, setting high expectations for many novel discoveries in the years
to come. Authors: A. Femius Koenderink, Andrea Al√π, Albert Polman
