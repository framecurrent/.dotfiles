Most polymers that we encounter, like those used in grocery bags and soda 
bottles, are formed from small molecules (monomers) held together by strong 
covalent bonds. In supramolecular polymerization, monomers bond through weaker 
reversible interactions, such as hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). Supramolecular 
polymerization usually proceeds through step-growth mechanisms (1), where both 
ends of each monomer are reactive and many smaller oligomers form before long 
polymers appear. To overcome this problem, a method developed for covalent 
polymers known as living polymerization has been adopted for supramolecular 
polymers to achieve better control and uniformity of chain growth and 
dispersity. Authors: Rahul Dev Mukhopadhyay, Ayyappanpillai Ajayaghosh
