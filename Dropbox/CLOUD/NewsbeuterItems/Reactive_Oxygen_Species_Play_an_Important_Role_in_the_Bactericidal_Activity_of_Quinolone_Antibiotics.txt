Abstract

Recent studies posit that reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the cell 
lethality of bactericidal antibiotics. However, this conjecture has been 
challenged and remains controversial. To resolve this controversy, we adopted a
strategy that involves DNA polymerase IV (PolIV). The nucleotide pool of the 
cell gets oxidized by ROS and PolIV incorporates the damaged nucleotides 
(especially 8oxodGTP) into the genome, which results in death of the bacteria. 
By using a combination of structural and biochemical tools coupled with growth 
assays, it was shown that selective perturbation of the 8oxodGTP incorporation 
activity of PolIV results in considerable enhancement of the survival of 
bacteria in the presence of the norfloxacin antibiotic. Our studies therefore 
indicate that ROS induced in bacteria by the presence of antibiotics in the 
environment contribute significantly to cell lethality.

Double peril: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidize the nucleotide pool and 
PolIV can incorporate the oxidized nucleotides into DNA. Structural and 
biochemical studies coupled with in vivo assays show that selective elimination
of the ability of PolIV to incorporate 8oxodGTP results in improved survival of
bacteria in the presence of antibiotics. These results indicate that the 
formation of ROS contributes substantially to the bactericidal activity of 
antibiotics.
