Abstract

Ruthenium(II) complexes containing the tetradentate ligand 
bis[4(4′-methyl-2,2′-bipyridyl)]-1,n-alkane (“bb[n]”; n=10 and 12) have been 
synthesised and their geometric isomers separated. All [Ru(phen)(bb[n])]^2+ 
(phen=1,10-phenanthroline) complexes exhibited excellent activity against 
Gram-positive bacteria, but only the cis-α-[Ru(phen)(bb[12])]^2+ species showed
good activity against Gram-negative species. In particular, the cis
-α-[Ru(phen)(bb[12])]^2+ complex was two to four times more active than the cis
-β-[Ru(phen)(bb[12])]^2+ complex against the Gram-negative strains. The cis-α- 
and cis-β-[Ru(phen)(bb[12])]^2+ complexes readily accumulated in the bacteria 
but, significantly, showed the highest level of uptake in Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. Furthermore, the accumulation of the cis-α- and cis-β-[Ru(phen)(bb[
12])]^2+ complexes in P. aeruginosa was considerably greater than in 
Escherichia coli. The uptake of the cis-α-[Ru(phen)(bb[12])]^2+ complex into 
live P. aeruginosa was confirmed by using fluorescence microscopy. The 
water/octanol partition coefficients (log P) were determined to gain 
understanding of the relative cellular uptake. The cis-α- and cis
-β-[Ru(phen)(bb[n])]^2+ complexes exhibited relatively strong binding to DNA (K[
b]≈10^6 M^−1), but no significant difference between the geometric isomers was 
observed.

New activity: The inert mononuclear ruthenium(II) complex cis-α-[Ru(phen)(bb[12]
)]^2+ ion (see picture; phen=1,10-phenanthroline, 
bb=bis[4(4′-methyl-2,2′-bipyridyl)]-1,n-alkane) readily accumulates in 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and showed good activity against it. This Gram-negative 
bacterium is of particular worldwide concern because it is naturally resistant 
to many antimicrobial agents due to the low permeability of its outer membrane.
