Abstract

Stimuli-responsive materials are of immense importance because of their ability
to undergo alteration of their properties in response to their environment. The
properties of such materials can be tuned by subtle adjustments in temperature,
pH, light, and so forth. Among such smart materials, multi-stimuli-responsive 
polymeric materials are of pronounced significance as they offer a wide range 
of applications and their properties can be tuned through several mechanisms. 
Here, we aim to highlight some recent studies showcasing the 
multi-stimuli-responsive character of these polymers, which are still 
relatively little known compared to their single-stimuli-responsive 
counterpart.

Responding to change: Stimuli-responsive materials are of immense importance 
because of their ability to undergo alteration of their properties in response 
to their environment. The properties of such materials can be tuned by subtle 
adjustments in temperature, pH, light, and so forth. This review article 
provides an overview of multi-stimuli-responsive polymeric materials.
