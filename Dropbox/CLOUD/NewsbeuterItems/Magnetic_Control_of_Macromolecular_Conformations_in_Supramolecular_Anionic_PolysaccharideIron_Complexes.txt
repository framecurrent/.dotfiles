Abstract

The anionic iota carrageenan polysaccharide is enriched with Fe^II and Fe^III 
by ion exchange against FeSO[4] and FeCl[3]. With divalent iron, portions of 
polymer chains undergo a secondary structure transition from random coils to 
single helices. The single-chain macromolecular conformations can be 
manipulated by an external magnetic field: upon exposure to 1.1 T, the helical 
portions exhibit 1.5-fold stiffening and 1.1-fold stretching, whereas the coil 
conformations respond much less as a result of lower contents of condensed iron
ions. Along with the coil–helix transition, the trivalent iron triggers the 
formation of superstructures. The applicability of iron-enriched iota 
carrageenan as functional ingredient for food fortification is tested by free 
Fe^2+ and Fe^3+ contents, respectively, with the most promising iota-Fe^III 
yielding 53 % of bound iron, which is due to the superstructures, where the 
ferric ions are chelated by the supramolecularly self-assembled polymer host.

Enrichment of iota carrageenan polysaccharides with Fe^2+ or Fe^3+ induces a 
conformational transition from random coils to single helices. The noninvasive 
magnetic manipulation of individual iota–Fe^II macromolecular conformations is 
demonstrated by a magnetically induced stiffening and stretching of the helical
chains. Multichain clusters arising from the efficient chelation of Fe^3+ may 
serve for iron food fortification purposes.
