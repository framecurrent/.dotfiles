Article

Cryptands and related molecules are macrocyclic polyethers capable of strongly 
binding cations. Here, the authors use orthoester exchange for the dynamic 
one-pot synthesis of crypates, which can bind cations and, given their 
constitutionally dynamic nature, can also be decomposed to release their guest.
