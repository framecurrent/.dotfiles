Abstract

Self-immolative spacers are covalent assemblies tailored to correlate the 
cleavage of two chemical bonds after activation of a protective part in a 
precursor: Upon stimulation, the protective moiety is removed, which generates 
a cascade of disassembling reactions leading to the temporally sequential 
release of smaller molecules. Originally introduced to overcome limitations for
drug delivery, self-immolative spacers have gained wide interest in medicinal 
chemistry, analytical chemistry, and material science. For most applications, 
the kinetics of the disassembly of the activated self-immolative spacer governs
functional properties. This Review addresses kinetic aspects of 
self-immolation. It provides information for selecting a particular 
self-immolative motif for a specific demand. Moreover, it should help 
researchers design kinetic experiments and fully exploit the rich perspectives 
of self-immolative spacers.

Time to cleave: Self-immolative spacers are covalent assemblies tailored to 
ensure the temporally tailored cleavage of two chemical bonds on activation. 
Upon stimulation, a protective moiety is removed from one side of the spacer, 
which then triggers the release of desired molecule. This Review deals with 
kinetics of disassembly in self-immolative spacers and provides information for
selecting a particular self-immolative motif for a specific demand.
