Abstract

Isoniazid-filled Fe[2]O[3] hollow nanospheres (INH@Fe[2]O[3], diameter <>30 nm,
48 wt % INH-load) are prepared for the first time and suggested for 
tuberculosis therapy. After dextran-functionalization, the INH@Fe[2]O[3]@DEX 
nanocontainers show strong activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.) 
and M.tb.-infected macrophages. The nanocontainers can be considered as “Trojan
horses” and show efficient, active uptake into both M.tb.-infected macrophages 
and even into mycobacterial cells.

Like a Trojan horse: Isoniazid-filled Fe[2]O[3] nanocontainers are actively 
taken up by tuberculosis-infected macrophages and show high activity against 
the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.). This type of container allows 
a much higher drug loading than other nanocontainer drug-delivery systems, and 
has a high biocompatibility and biodegradability.
