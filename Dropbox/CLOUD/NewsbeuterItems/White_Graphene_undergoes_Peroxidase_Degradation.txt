Abstract

Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanosheets are emerging as promising 2D materials
for different types of applications. However, biodegradation of hBN materials 
is poorly explored owing to their high chemical inertness and strong oxidation 
resistance. The assessment of oxidation/biodegradation of hBN is important in 
developing biomedical tools. Herein, we report the first study on the 
biodegradability of hBN nanosheets comparing the enzymatic catalysis of two 
different peroxidases, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and human myeloperoxidase 
(MPO), with the photo-Fenton (P.F.) reaction. The results show that degradation
of hBN nanosheets is different to that of graphene and graphene oxide, since 
partial oxidation was found using MPO after 35 h, while HRP failed to degrade 
hBN up to 60 days. Nearly complete oxidation/degradation was occurred by P.F. 
reaction in 100 h. These results are helpful in designing advanced conjugates 
for biomedical uses of hBN.

Between the sheets: Biodegradability of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) 
nanosheets was investigated using different conditions including treatment with
human myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the UV-assisted photo-Fenton (P.F.) reaction. 
The photo-Fenton reaction almost completely degrades hBN nanosheets. These 
studies are important for designing safer hBN-based materials for biomedical 
uses and polymer-composites.
