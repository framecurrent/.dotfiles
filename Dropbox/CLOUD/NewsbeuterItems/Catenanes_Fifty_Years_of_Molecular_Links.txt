Abstract

Half a century after Schill and Lüttringhaus carried out the first directed 
synthesis of a [2]catenane, a plethora of strategies now exist for the 
construction of molecular Hopf links (singly interlocked rings), the simplest 
type of catenane. The precision and effectiveness with which suitable templates
and/or noncovalent interactions can arrange building blocks has also enabled 
the synthesis of intricate and often beautiful higher order interlocked 
systems, including Solomon links, Borromean rings, and a Star of David 
catenane. This Review outlines the diverse strategies that exist for 
synthesizing catenanes in the 21st century and examines their emerging 
applications and the challenges that still exist for the synthesis of more 
complex topologies.

Half a century after Schill and Lüttringhaus carried out the first directed 
synthesis of a [2]catenane, a plethora of strategies now exist for the 
construction of interlocked molecular rings. Effective template synthesis 
enables the synthesis of higher order interlocked systems. This Review outlines
the diverse strategies that exist for forming catenanes, their applications, 
and the important challenges that remain in the field of chemical topology.
