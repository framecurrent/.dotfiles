Abstract

A supramolecular antibiotic switch is described that can reversibly “turn-on” 
and “turn-off” its antibacterial activity on demand, providing a 
proof-of-concept for a way to regulate antibacterial activity of biotics. The 
switch relies on supramolecular assembly and disassembly of cationic 
poly(phenylene vinylene) derivative (PPV) with cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) to 
regulate their different interactions with bacteria. This simple but efficient 
strategy does not require any chemical modification on the active sites of the 
antibacterial agent, and could also regulate the antibacterial activity of 
classical antibiotics or photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. This 
supramolecular antibiotic switch may be a successful strategy to fight 
bacterial infections and decrease the emergence of bacterial resistance to 
antibiotics from a long-term point of view.

A supramolecular antibiotic switch to reversibly “turn-on” and “turn-off” its 
antibacterial activity on demand was developed as a proof-of-concept to 
regulate antibacterial activity of biotics. The switch relies on the 
supramolecular assembly and disassembly of a poly(phenylene vinylene) 
derivative (PPV) with cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) that regulates their interactions
with bacteria. This strategy does not require any chemical modification on the 
active sites of the antibacterial agent, and could also regulate the 
antibacterial activity of classical antibiotics or photosensitizers in 
photodynamic therapy.
