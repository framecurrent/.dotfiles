Immune systems distinguish “self” from “nonself” to maintain homeostasis and 
must differentially gate access to allow colonization by potentially 
beneficial, nonpathogenic microbes. Plant roots grow within extremely diverse 
soil microbial communities but assemble a taxonomically limited root-associated
microbiome. We grew isogenic Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with altered immune 
systems in a wild soil and also in recolonization experiments with a synthetic 
bacterial community. We established that biosynthesis of, and signaling 
dependent on, the foliar defense phytohormone salicylic acid is required to 
assemble a normal root microbiome. Salicylic acid modulates colonization of the
root by specific bacterial families. Thus, plant immune signaling drives 
selection from the available microbial communities to sculpt the root 
microbiome. Authors: Sarah L. Lebeis, Sur Herrera Paredes, Derek S. Lundberg,
