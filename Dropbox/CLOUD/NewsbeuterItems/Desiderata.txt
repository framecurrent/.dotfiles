When "Zen Pencils" cartoonist Gavin Than asked fans to vote for their favorite 
poem to be turned into a comic strip, they chose "Desiderata", the widely 
popular poem written by Max Ehrmann in 1927, whose title in Latin translates to
"things to be desired". The poem has been described as a survival guide for 
life. Than's illustrations bring these celebrated words alive in a unique way.
