Biorenewable carbohydrate feedstocks can be efficiently converted into a 
diverse set of oxygen-functionalized chiral synthons using a combination of a 
tertiary silane and the catalyst B(C6F5)3. The deoxygenation mechanism involves
cyclic intermediates, which provide a means of controlling chemo- and 
diastereoselectivity.
