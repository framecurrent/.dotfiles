Orthogonal dynamic covalent self-assembly has been used for high-throughput 
determination of the enantiomeric purity of chiral amines. The method, 
described by P. Anzenbacher and co-workers in their Communication (DOI: 
10.1002/anie.201501736[3]) is based on the self-assembly of 
2-formylphenylboronic acid with a chiral diol auxiliary and a chiral amine of 
unknown chirality to produce two diastereomeric iminoboronates that differ in 
their fluorescence, as measured using a microplate reader. The approach allows 
accurate determination of the ee value of chiral amines with errors below 2%.
