Engineered nanoparticles (eNPs) for biological and biomedical applications are 
produced from functionalised nanoparticles (NPs) after undergoing multiple 
handling steps, giving rise to an inevitable loss of NPs. Herein we present a 
practical method to quantify nanoparticles (NPs) number per volume in an 
aqueous suspension using standard spectrophotometers and minute amounts of the 
suspensions (up to 1 μL). This method allows, for the first time, to analyse 
cellular uptake by reporting NPs number added per cell, as opposed to current 
methods which are related to solid content (w/V) of NPs. In analogy to the 
parameter used in viral infective assays (multiplicity of infection), we 
propose to name this novel parameter as multiplicity of nanofection.
