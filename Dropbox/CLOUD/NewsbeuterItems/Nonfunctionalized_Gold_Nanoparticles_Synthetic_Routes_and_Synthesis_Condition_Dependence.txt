Abstract

Since Faraday first described gold sol synthesis, synthetic routes to 
nanoparticles, as well as their applications, have experienced a huge growth. 
Variations in synthesis conditions such as pH, temperature, reduction, and the 
stabilizing agent used will determine the morphology, size, monodispersity, and
stability of nanoparticles obtained, allowing for modulation of their physical 
and chemical properties. Although many studies have been made about the 
synthesis and characterization of individual nanosystems of interest, to our 
knowledge the common, general traits that all those synthesis share have not 
been previously compiled. In this review, we aim to offer a global vision of 
some of the most relevant synthetic procedures reported up to date, with a 
special focus on nonfunctionalized gold nanoparticle synthetic routes in 
aqueous media, and to display a broad overview of the influence that synthesis 
conditions have on the shape, stability, and reactivity of nanoparticle 
systems.

Going for gold: The optical and physical properties of gold nanoparticles are 
strongly dependent on their synthesis conditions. In this review, a 
comprehensive view of the influence of several synthesis factors, such as pH, 
reducing or capping agents, or temperature, is presented in order to help 
ascertain their influence on the shape and stability of the resulting 
nanosystems (see figure).
