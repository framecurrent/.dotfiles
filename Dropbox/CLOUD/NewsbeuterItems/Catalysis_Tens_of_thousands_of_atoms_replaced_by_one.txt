Catalysis: Tens of thousands of atoms replaced by one

Nature 525, 7569 (2015). doi:10.1038/525325a[1]

Authors: John Meurig Thomas

Many catalysts comprise metal nanoparticles on solid supports. The discovery 
that single atoms of palladium anchored to a solid support also exhibit high 
catalytic activity might help to conserve the supply of this and related rare 
metals.
