Chemistry: X-rays make molecular movie

Nature 522, 7557 (2015). doi:10.1038/522395a[1]

Researchers have made a film of a molecule's structural changes during a 
chemical reaction.A team led by Michael Minitti at the SLAC National 
Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, California, used a powerful free-electron
laser to fire ultrafast X-ray pulses at the ring structure of
