The use of Catechin as an antibacterial agent is becoming ever-more common, 
whereas unstable and easy oxidation, have limited its application. A simple and
low-energy-consuming approach to synthesize highly stable and dispersive 
Catechin-Cu nanoparticles(NPs) has been developed, in which the stability and 
dispersivity of the NPs are varied greatly with the pH value and temperature of
the reaction. The results demonstrate that the optimal reaction conditions are 
pH 11 at room temperature. As-synthesized NPs display excellent antimicrobial 
activity, the survival rates of bacterial cells exposed to the NPs were 
evaluated using live/dead Bacterial Viability Kit. The results showed that NPs 
at the concentration of 10 ppm and 20 ppm provided rapid and effective killing 
of up to 90% and 85% of S. aureus and E. coli within 3 h, respectively. After 
treatment with 20 ppm and 40 ppm NPs, the bacteria are killed completely. 
Furthermore, on the basis of assessing the antibacterial effects by SEM, TEM, 
and AFM, it was found the cell membrane damage of the bacteria caused by direct
contact of the bacteria with the NPs was the effective mechanism in the 
bacterial inactivation.
