Abstract

Whenever nanoparticles encounter biological fluids like blood, proteins adsorb 
on their surface and form a so-called protein corona. Although its importance 
is widely accepted, information on the influence of surface functionalization 
of nanocarriers on the protein corona is still sparse, especially concerning 
how the functionalization of PEGylated nanocarriers with targeting agents will 
affect protein corona formation and how the protein corona may in turn 
influence the targeting effect. Herein, hydroxyethyl starch nanocarriers 
(HES-NCs) were prepared, PEGylated, and modified on the outer PEG layer with 
mannose to target dendritic cells (DCs). Their interaction with human plasma 
was then studied. Low overall protein adsorption with a distinct protein 
pattern and high specific affinity for DC binding were observed, thus 
indicating an efficient combination of “stealth” and targeting behavior.

Stealth nanocariers: The blood plasma interactions and targeting properties of 
PEGylated and mannose-functionalized hydroxyethyl starch (HES) nanocarriers 
were investigated. They exhibit colloidal stability in human plasma, low 
protein adsorption, a distinct protein pattern, and highly specific cellular 
uptake into dendritic cells both before and after contact with human plasma.
