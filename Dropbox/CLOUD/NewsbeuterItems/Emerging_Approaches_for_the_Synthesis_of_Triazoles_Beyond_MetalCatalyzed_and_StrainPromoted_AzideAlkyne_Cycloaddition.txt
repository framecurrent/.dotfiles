Berkel, Carolina LimaMetal-free 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions have proven
to be a powerful tool for the assembly of key heterocycles, in particular 
diversely functionalized 1,2,3-triazoles. A number of metal-free 
(3+2)-cycloaddition approaches have been...The content of this RSS Feed (c) The
