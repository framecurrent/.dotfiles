Mark B Richardson, Shota Torigoe, Sho Yamasaki, Spencer J WilliamsMycobacterium
tuberculosis H37Ra produces a range of immunogenic [small beta]-gentiobiosyl 
diacylglycerides. We report the total synthesis of several candidate structures
and show that these compounds signal weakly through mouse, but not...The
