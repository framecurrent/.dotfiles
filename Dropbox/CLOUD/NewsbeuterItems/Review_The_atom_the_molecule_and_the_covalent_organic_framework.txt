Just over a century ago, Lewis published his seminal work on what became known 
as the covalent bond, which has since occupied a central role in the theory of 
making organic molecules. With the advent of covalent organic frameworks 
(COFs), the chemistry of the covalent bond was extended to two- and 
three-dimensional frameworks. Here, organic molecules are linked by covalent 
bonds to yield crystalline, porous COFs from light elements (boron, carbon, 
nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon) that are characterized by high architectural and
chemical robustness. This discovery paved the way for carrying out chemistry on
frameworks without losing their porosity or crystallinity, and in turn 
achieving designed properties in materials. The recent union of the covalent 
and the mechanical bond in the COF provides the opportunity for making woven 
structures that incorporate flexibility and dynamics into frameworks. Authors:
