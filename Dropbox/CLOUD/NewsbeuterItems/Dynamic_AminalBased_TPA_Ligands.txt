Abstract

The use of dynamic covalent reactions (DCRs) is gaining popularity for the 
construction of self-assembling architectures. We have recently introduced DCRs
that exchange alcohols and aldehydes to create hemiaminal ethers within 
tri(2-picolyl)amine (TPA) ligands, all of which are templated by Zn^II. To 
expand the scope of this assembly, aromatic imines derived from 
pyridine-2-carboxyaldehyde were explored as dynamic covalent receptors for 
di(2-picolyl)amine in the presence of Zn^II to create TPA ligands that contain 
aminal linkages. This represents another metal-templated in situ multicomponent
assembly. The stability of the assembly was successfully modulated through 
substituent effects, and the equilibrium constants from imines to aminals were 
correlated by a linear free energy relationship (LFER) with Ïƒ^+ values. Dynamic
component exchange was investigated as a means of probing multiple equilibriums
quantitatively in the system. Further, the mechanism was analyzed with a 
qualitative kinetics study. NMR spectra reveal the different extents of two 
competing pathways for assembly depending upon whether the aromatic amine has 
electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups on the ring. Finally, mass 
spectral evidence supports the presence and differing extents of dominance of 
the two pathways as a function of the substituents.

Probing pathways: Dynamic covalent reactions (DCRs) of aromatic amines to 
create imines that convert to tri(2-picolyl)amine (TPA)-like ligands were 
studied in detail. The multicomponent assembly was conducted as a means of 
creating imines in situ and controlling the competing pathway (see figure; 
DPA=di(2-picolyl)amine).
