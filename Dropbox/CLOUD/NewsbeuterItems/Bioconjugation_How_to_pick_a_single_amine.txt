Single-step site-specific labeling of native proteins is one of the holy grails
in the chemical biology field. 2-Pyridinecarboxyaldehyde derivatives are shown 
to react selectively at the N terminus of proteins to form stable conjugates, 
irrespective of the nature of the N-terminal amino acid, enabling the 
straightforward introduction of useful functional groups into a wide array of 
proteins.
