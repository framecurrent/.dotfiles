Abstract

Delivery vehicles that are able to actively seek and precisely locate targeted 
tissues using concentration gradients of signaling molecules have hardly been 
explored. The directed movement toward specific cell types of cargo-loaded 
polymeric nanomotors along a hydrogen peroxide concentration gradient 
(chemotaxis) is reported. Through self-assembly, bowl-shaped poly(ethylene 
glycol)-b-polystyrene nanomotors, or stomatocytes, were formed with platinum 
nanoparticles entrapped in the cavity while a model drug was encapsulated in 
the inner compartment. Directional movement of the stomatocytes in the presence
of a fuel gradient (chemotaxis) was first demonstrated in both static and 
dynamic systems using glass channels and a microfluidic flow. The highly 
efficient response of these motors was subsequently shown by their directional 
and autonomous movement towards hydrogen peroxide secreting neutrophil cells.

Chemotactic nanoparticles: Platinum-loaded polystyrene nanoparticles were shown
to exhibit directional movement along hydrogen peroxide gradients in both 
static and flowing systems. Furthermore, the nanoparticles could encapsulate 
the model cancer drug doxorubicin and migrate towards hydrogen 
peroxide-producing neutrophil cells, suggesting such nanoparticles could be 
used as drug delivery vehicles.
