A luminogen with aggregation-induced emission characteristics is reported for 
bacterial imaging and antibiotics screening studies. The luminogen can light up
bacteria in a wash-free manner, which simplifies the imaging process and 
increases its accuracy in bacterial detection. It can also be applied to 
high-throughput screening of antibiotics and fast evaluation of bacterial 
susceptibility, giving reliable results in less than 5 h.
