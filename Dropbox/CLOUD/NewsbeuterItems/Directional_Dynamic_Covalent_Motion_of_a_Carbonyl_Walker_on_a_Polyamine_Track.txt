Abstract

Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Jean-Marie Lehn at the 
Université de Strasbourg (France). The image depicts the trend of the research 
activities pursued in our laboratory in Strasbourg over 50 years towards 
chemical systems, entities and processes, of increasing complexity. Read the

“Although it looked rather straightforward at the start, the synthesis of an 
unsymmetrical polyamine track turned out to be quite challenging and required 
many attempts until achieving success.” Read more about the story behind the 
cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page ▪▪ ff. (DOI: 
10.1002/chem.201500987[1]).
