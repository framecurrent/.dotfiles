Article

Hollow, spherical nano/microstructures are potentially useful for energy and 
drug delivery applications. Here, the authors show that these structures can be
fabricated from covalent organic frameworks, and exploit their chemical 
stability and mesoporous structures for enzyme encapsulation.
