As nanotheranostics, Congo red/Rutin-MNPs combine the abilities of diagnosis 
and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biocompatible nanotheranostics 
system based on iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles, with ultrasmall size and 
excellent magnetic properties, can specifically detect amyloid plaques by 
magnetic resonance imaging, realize targeted delivery of AD therapeutic agents,
achieve drug controlled release by H[2]O[2] response, and prevent oxidative 
stress.
