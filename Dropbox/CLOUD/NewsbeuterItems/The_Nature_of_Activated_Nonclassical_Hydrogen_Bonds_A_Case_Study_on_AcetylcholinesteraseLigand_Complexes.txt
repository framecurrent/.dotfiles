The nature of non-classical hydrogen bonds of the CH⋅⋅⋅Y type involving 
electron-deficient CH donors has been investigated. The hydrogen bonds between 
the enzyme acetylcholinesterase and different drug-like ligands were 
computationally analysed in their original protein milieu. The results show 
that the CH⋅⋅⋅O and CH⋅⋅⋅arene interactions activated by a proximal cation are 
dispersion dominated and comparable to or greater in strength than classical 
hydrogen bonds. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Linusson 
et al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201503973[3]).
