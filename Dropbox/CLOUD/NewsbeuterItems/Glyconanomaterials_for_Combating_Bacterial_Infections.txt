Abstract

Bacterial infections constitute an increasing problem to human health in 
response to build-up of resistance to present antibiotics and sluggish 
development of new pharmaceuticals. However, a means to address this problem is
to pinpoint the drug delivery to—and into—the bacteria. This results in a high 
local concentration of the drug, circumventing the increasingly high doses 
otherwise necessary. Combined with other effectors, such as covalent attachment
to carriers, rendering the drugs less degradable, and the combination with 
efflux inhibitors, old drugs can be revived. In this context, 
glyconanomaterials offer exceptional potential, since these materials can be 
tailored to accommodate different effectors. In this Concept article, we 
describe the different advantages of glyconanomaterials, and point to their 
potential in antibiotic “revitalization”.

Small wonder: Glyconanomaterials (see figure) offer exceptional potential 
towards combating bacterial infections. These materials can accommodate 
different effectors and be tailored in terms of targeting, size, shape, 
presentation, etc. In this Concept article, the different advantages of 
glyconanomaterials are described, and their potential in antibiotic 
“revitalization” is pointed out.
