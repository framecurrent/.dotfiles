Article

Dynamic nuclear polarization is the transfer of electronic angular momentum to 
nuclear spins and is a potential route for coherently manipulating spin in 
quantum information. Here, the authors show that spin–orbit coupling can quench
dynamic nuclear polarization in a gallium arsenide quantum dot.
