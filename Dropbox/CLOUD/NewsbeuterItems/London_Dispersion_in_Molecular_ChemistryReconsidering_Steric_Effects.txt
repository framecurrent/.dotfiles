Abstract

London dispersion, which constitutes the attractive part of the famous van der 
Waals potential, has long been underappreciated in molecular chemistry as an 
important element of structural stability, and thus affects chemical reactivity
and catalysis. This negligence is due to the common notion that dispersion is 
weak, which is only true for one pair of interacting atoms. For increasingly 
larger structures, the overall dispersion contribution grows rapidly and can 
amount to tens of kcal mol^−1. This Review collects and emphasizes the 
importance of inter- and intramolecular dispersion for molecules consisting 
mostly of first row atoms. The synergy of experiment and theory has now reached
a stage where dispersion effects can be examined in fine detail. This forces us
to reconsider our perception of steric hindrance and stereoelectronic effects. 
The quantitation of dispersion energy donors will improve our ability to design
sophisticated molecular structures and much better catalysts.

Center of attraction: Dispersion attraction makes all the difference in the 
stability of molecular structures, reactivity, and the design of catalysts. 
Although small for one pair of interactions, dispersion grows rapidly as the 
molecular size increases.
