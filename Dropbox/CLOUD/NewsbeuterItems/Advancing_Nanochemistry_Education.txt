Abstract

The chemical approach to nanotechnology that has emerged in the last three 
decades has proved to be extremely fertile. As chemistry increasingly turns 
into nanochemistry, and renewable solar energy available in sunlight and in 
biomass emerges as the main energy and raw materials source available to 
mankind, effective teaching of nanochemistry becomes increasingly important. 
This Viewpoint identifies the requirements of a short course aimed to provide 
future scholars with the conceptual foundations, and a clear perspective, of an
important discipline which turned out to be the enabler of nanotechnology.

Taught in the right way: As chemistry increasingly turns into nanochemistry, 
and renewable solar energy available in sunlight and in biomass emerges as the 
main energy and raw materials source available to mankind, effective teaching 
of nanochemistry becomes increasingly important.
