Article

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are widely used to treat serious bacterial 
infections, but resistance is an increasing problem. Here the authors describe 
the synthesis and characterization of novel deoxynybomycin derivatives that 
exhibit activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant infections in an in vivo 
model.
