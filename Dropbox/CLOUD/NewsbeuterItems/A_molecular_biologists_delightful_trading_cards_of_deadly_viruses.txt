Up close, deadly viruses are like snowflakes, says Eleanor Lutz[2], a first 
year PhD biology student at the University of Washington and self-described 
infographics fanatic.

As an experiment, she created a set of beautifully rendered virus trading cards[3]
depicting the molecular structure of dengue, adenovirus, HPV and chlorella. 
“Viruses are surprisingly symmetrical, and I love them because they remind me 
of a biological version of snowflakes,” she writes on her blog[3]. Each 
animated “trading card” also contains the virus’s killer stats including its 
Protein Data Bank[4] ID number from the database scientists use to publish 
newly discovered protein structures.

Lutz, who is studying the neurobiology of dengue-spreading mosquitos, says that
was inspired to make the cards after learning how to use a molecular modeling 
program called Chimera[5]. “I thought it was a really fun and powerful program 
so I decided to see if I could use it in a design project,” Lutz says.

As a careful scientist would, Lutz cited the source of her data, her 
methodology and published a step-by-step guide[6] on how to make animated 
infographics on her website.
