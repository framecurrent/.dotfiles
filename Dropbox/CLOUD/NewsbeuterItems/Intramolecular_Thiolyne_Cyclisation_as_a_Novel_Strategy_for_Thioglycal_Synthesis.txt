Vincent Corce, Lauren McSweeney, Aoife Malone, Eoin M ScanlanA novel 
intramolecular thiol-yne cyclisation strategy has been developed for the 
synthesis of thioglycals. Both ionic and radical mediated cyclisation pathways 
have been investigated for D- and L-sugars. The ionic...The content of this RSS
