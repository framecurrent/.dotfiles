Abstract

Multicomponent surface architectures are introduced that operate with three 
different dynamic covalent bonds. Disulfide exchange under basic conditions 
accounts for the growth of Ï€ stacks on solid surfaces. Hydrazone exchange under
acidic conditions is used to add a second coaxial string or stack, and boronic 
ester exchange under neutral conditions is used to co-align a third one. The 
newly introduced boronic ester exchange chemistry is compatible with stack and 
string exchange without interference from the orthogonal hydrazone and 
disulfide exchange. The functional relevance of surface architectures with 
three different dynamic covalent bonds is exemplified with the detection of 
polyphenol natural products, such as epigallocatechin gallate, in competition 
experiments with alizarin red. These results describe synthetic strategies to 
create functional systems of unprecedented sophistication with regard to 
dynamic covalent chemistry.

Designer architectures: Disulfide exchange under basic conditions, hydrazone 
exchange under acidic conditions, and boronic ester exchange at neutral pH 
values are combined to build multicomponent functional surface architectures 
using dynamic covalent chemistry. TSA/TSR=templated stack addition/release.
