For the past few decades, the civil aviation industry has increased its efforts
to prevent fuel fires initiated by aviation crashes by improving fuel safety 
and handling. These fires are estimated to be responsible for 40% of 
fatalities, corresponding to approximately 500 to 1000 deaths that could be 
minimized annually with improved fire-safe fuel (1). Fuel fires are also 
increasingly becoming a hazard to homeland security, as seen in the example of 
the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centers (2). The mist is much
more flammable than the liquid, and antimisting kerosene (AMK) interferes with 
mist formation by incorporating a low concentration (<>0.3 weight percent) of 
high molecular weight polymer; (FM-9) into Jet-A fuel (3). However, routine 
handling (e.g., passage through pumps) (see the photo) breaks the polymer chain
through hydrodynamic tension, and it becomes inadequate for mist suppression 
(4). The challenge is to find a mist-control polymer that is stable at handling
conditions. On page 72 of this issue, Wei et al. (5) show how telechelic 
polymers that break and reassemble can be effective mist suppressors under real
handling and fuel-injection conditions. Authors: Michael Jaffe, Sahitya Allam
