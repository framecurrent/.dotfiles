Abstract

We report evidence of the favorable noncovalent interaction between a 
covalently bonded atom of Group 18 (known as noble gases or aerogens) and a 
negative site, for example, a lone pair of a Lewis base or an anion. It 
involves a region of positive electrostatic potential (σ-hole), therefore it is
a totally new and unexplored σ-hole-based interaction, namely aerogen bonding. 
We demonstrate for the first time the existence of σ-hole regions in aerogen 
derivatives by means of high-level ab initio calculations. In addition, several
crystal structures retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) give 
reliability to the calculations. Energetically, aerogen bonds are comparable to
hydrogen bonds and other σ-hole-based interactions but less directional. They 
are expected to be important in xenon chemistry.

A new noncovalent interaction between a covalently bonded atom of Group 18 and 
a negative site, for example, a lone pair of a Lewis base or an anion, is 
called an aerogen bonding. It involves a region of positive electrostatic 
potential (σ-hole). Energetically, aerogen bonds are comparable to hydrogen 
bonds and other σ-hole-based interactions but less directional. They might be 
important in xenon chemistry.
