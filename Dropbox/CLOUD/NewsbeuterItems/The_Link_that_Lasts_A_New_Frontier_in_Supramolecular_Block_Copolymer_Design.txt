Lasting link: A supramolecular linkage between two parts of an amphiphilic 
block copolymer was developed that is sufficiently strong to allow 
phase-separation-driven nanopatterning as well as chromatographic 
characterization. The link can also be severed in response to a solvent trigger
signal. This powerful approach will open new avenues for the production of 
self-healing materials, triggered-release systems, and reversible surface 
designs.
