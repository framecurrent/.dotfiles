Abstract

Molecular capsules composed of amino acid or peptide derivatives connected to 
resorcin[4]arene scaffolds through acylhydrazone linkers have been synthesized 
using dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) and hydrogen-bond-based self-assembly. 
The dynamic character of the linkers and the preference of the peptides towards
self-assembly into β-barrel-type motifs lead to the spontaneous amplification 
of formation of homochiral capsules from mixtures of different substrates. The 
capsules have cavities of around 800 Å^3 and exhibit good kinetic stability. 
Although they retain their dynamic character, which allows processes such as 
chiral self-sorting and chiral self-assembly to operate with high fidelity, 
guest complexation is hindered in solution. However, the quantitative 
complexation of even very large guests, such as fullerene C[60] or C[70], is 
possible through the utilization of reversible covalent bonds or the 
application of mechanochemical methods. The NMR spectra show the influence of 
the chiral environment on the symmetry of the fullerene molecules, which 
results in the differentiation of diastereotopic carbon atoms for C[70], and 
the X-ray structures provide unique information on the modes of 
peptide–fullerene interactions.

Molecular capsules: Peptidic capsules based on minimal β-barrel motifs have 
been formed from short peptides and a dynamic covalent chemistry approach. The 
complexation of fullerenes (see figure), used as surface-inactive probes, was 
achieved by chemical and mechanochemical methods.
